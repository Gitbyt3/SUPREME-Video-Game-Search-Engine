Digital board game adaptations for tablet,Gomoku Narabe Renju,8503,0.24007928860142944,"Aug 27, 1983",Nintendo,"A board game simulation for the Famicom. The goal is to line up five pieces in a row.
Gomoku Narabe Renju is a video game simulation of a traditional Eastern board game that uses the board and pieces from the popular board game Go. It plays a lot like the American board game Connect Four, in which the goal is to line up a series of five tiles horizontally, vertically or diagonally before the other player can do the same. Two players take it in turns to place a single Go tile on the board, attempting to craft their own lines while strategically placing tiles that blocks the opponent from finishing theirs.
While the normal board game is simply referred to as ""Gomoku Narabe"" (Five Pieces in a Row, occasionally translated as Gobang), the Renju modifier is an additional rule that makes it harder for the player with the black pieces to win. Because the black player always begins each game (like how the white player always begins each game of Chess), this additional rule is thought to even the playing field. The rule is that the black player will lose if they build a line of six or more pieces: this counts as going ""overlong"" and counts as a loss.
Gomoku Narabe Renju is the fourth video game ever released on the Famicom, and the first original game produced for the system (the previous three - Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye - were all ports of arcade games). It was released the same day (August 27th, 1983) as the Famicom version of Mahjong, another board game adaptation.",Wii U | Wii | Family Computer (FAMICOM),Card & Board Game,2.4,16.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0

After Ogami Ittō's wife Azami gives birth to their son, Daigorō, Ogami Ittō returns to find her and all of their household brutally murdered, with only the newborn Daigorō surviving. The supposed culprits are three former retainers of an abolished clan, avenging the execution of their lord by Ogami Ittō. However, the entire matter was planned by Ura-Yagyū (Shadow Yagyu) Yagyū Retsudō, leader of the Ura-Yagyū clan, in order to seize Ogami's post as part of a masterplan to control the three key positions of power: the spy system, the official assassins and the Shogunate Decapitator. During the initial incursion, an ihai (funeral tablet) with the shōgun's crest on it was placed inside the Ogami family shrine, signifying a supposed wish for the shogun's death. When the tablet is ""discovered"" during the murder investigation, its presence condemns Ittō as a traitor and thus he is forced to forfeit his post.",Arcade,Adventure,3.5,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,2.0

It is the third game in the Nostalgia series and a spiritual successor to Konami's Keyboardmania series.
The game consists of falling bars corresponding to certain areas of the keyboard. When the bars cross the judgement line it is time to play that key. There are three type of notes - Normal note which you play as normal, slide note where you slide your hand across the keyboard and trill note where you rapidly and alternately press two neighbouring keys.
Op.3 adds more sorting functionality to the song selection screens, which is needed as the song list has grown in size. It also allows you to filter on your scores and grades, making it easier to improve your overall skill level in the game. Recital mode is now a toggle on the standard mode instead of another mode.
This is the first time in the series where some songs are not carried over from previous version, due to licenses not being renewed. 75 songs were brought forward from Nostalgia, 97 from Nostalgia: Forte and 126 from Nostalgia: Op.2. Along with the 49 new songs in Op.3, that brings the total song list up to 347 songs (as of 27th June 2020).

Rhythm Tengoku contains 48 minigames that put your rhythm to the test in a variety of crazy scenarios.
Rhythm Tengoku was developed by Nintendo R&D1 and released exclusively in Japan for the GBA in 2006 and in arcades with Sega's help in 2007. Being developed by the same studio responsible for the WarioWare games, Rhythm Tengoku mixes the mini-game based gameplay with rhythm game elements, featuring unusually high-quality music for a GBA game. The game started development in 2004. A 2002 prototype for a GBA drum sequencer was incorporated into Rhythm Tengoku as well: the player can freely drum within the Sound Test or take on 19 drum lessons. (Source)
The game contains eight stages with five rhythm games and one remix of the previous five each, adding up to 48 different mini-games total. Each game can be completed without hitting every note perfectly, although doing so will unlock various rhythm-related bonus games and modes, such as a drum set where you have to mimic what the drummer does.
Much like the Wario Ware series of games, Rhythm Tengoku is all about following your senses and trying to be aware of various cues in the visuals and audio. This emphasis on sense instead of language makes it quite easy for anyone to pick up and play, even though the game is entirely in Japanese (and consequently only available in the Asian region or through an import website).
For example, one of the game's levels has you rapping with a computer-controlled character. He'll speak a colour-coded Japanese phrase, and the player must press 'A' in different rhythms. Although the game explains what rhythms to do for which phrase, non-Japanese speaking players can watch hand movements on-screen to figure it out without the need for language.
Occasionally, challenges will crop up, asking you to complete a level without any mistakes. Doing so earns you a certificate for that level, and a pink heart with a 'P' on it appears in that level's description.",Game Boy Advance,Music,3.9,839.0,21.0,180.0,101.0,180.0,97.0

Your people emerge from a long period hidden underground and they’ve forgotten the world above.

Manage resources, discover ancient tech and create a multi-planet network of colonies to thrive in your solar system.
But the universe is not always a safe place. Ancient guardians, remnants of your ancestors, will demand your attention and challenge your cities. The planets you inhabit are scarred by the disasters that forced your forebears underground, and those disasters will still plague you if not managed properly. And most of all, watch out for vast planet-eating space whales coming to graze on your planets!
Before We Leave is a (mostly) non-violent game.

The game is played over the Internet or a LAN. There are a variety of game modes to choose from, ranging from the free-for-all (Deathmatch) to the team-based (Capture the Flag). In some modes holding or defending a flag is the primary goal, where in others it is simply to obtain the most frags. For all game modes, the basic objective is to kill enemy players. Before spawning, the player is presented with a large arsenal of weapons to choose from. A few grenades and a molotov cocktail are also supplied by default and more grenades can be picked up from the ground. Some servers enable secondary functions like knives, shields or nuclear kamikaze attacks. Upon death players leave behind a health pack for healing injury, the weapon and any equipped grenades for others to pick up. After waiting for a server-specified amount of time (usually less than five seconds), players respawn and may choose another weapon—this cycle repeats for the duration of the map. After a certain allotted time (usually 15 minutes), the map changes and scores are reset as players continue in another round.
