Its Open Beta stage was announced at the Game Developers Conference in 2007. It makes use of Adobe Flash as an applet embedded into the website while also having pages of HTML and JavaScript in a sidebar to allow players to manage their friends list and browse various categories of user-generated content.
The concept is comparable to the virtual worlds in the PlayStation 3 game Home and Second Life, while also incorporating aspects of feed-based social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. It pushes to make all content user-created, mainly with its approach to creative accessibility using Flash's affinity for 2D vector graphics and various web compatibilities to make it very simple for players to upload a wide variety of content using simple, conventional file formats.
Upon Grey Havens releasing the source code for Whirled under their BSD License, several mirror sites formed. While they had no access to the original database, a lot of content was copied across to create a similar experience managed by the community.

As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.
Players assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as ""Root Towns"" that are free of combat. They also can ""log-off"" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called ""Crimson VS"" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","['Windows PC', 'Nintendo GameCube', 'Xbox', 'PlayStation 3', 'PlayStation 2']","['Adventure', 'Platform']",3.6,6200.0,52.0,1300.0,510.0,577.0,150.0,,2

It was a spin-off from the Legacy of Kain series of action-adventure games, and took place in its eponymous fictional universe. Nosgoth employed a player versus player system in which each match consisted of two rounds. Teams were composed of characters assigned to one of two races: vampires, designed around hack and slash combat; and humans, whose gameplay was styled after third-person shooters. Between rounds, teams would switch to control the opposing race, and the team which accumulated the most points by fighting their counterparts won the match.
Initially announced in June 2013 following internet leaks, Nosgoth was the first Legacy of Kain-associated game to debut in almost ten years, preceded by 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Though once intended for release as part of a single-player project, Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun, it was reconceptualized and continued development as a standalone title following Dead Sun's cancellation. When officially revealed in September 2013, Nosgoth attracted negative reception for its conceptual departure from the traditional single-player and story-driven Legacy of Kain formula. Initially beginning its closed alpha and opening up its servers to registered players in late 2013, the game's open beta began in January 2015 and ended in May 2016.
On April 8, 2016, Square Enix Europe announced that Nosgoth's servers would shut down on May 31, 2016. Nosgoth's official forums also shut down on June 14, 2016.",['Windows PC'],"['Fighting', 'Shooter']",2.7,157.0,0.0,28.0,2.0,11.0,4.0,,1

Four incarnations of the game were produced during its one-year development; the first featured more common first-person shooter elements than the released version. Subsequent versions shifted in a new direction, with the inclusion of more spy-oriented gameplay.
Gravity Bone received critical acclaim from video game journalists. It was called ""a pleasure to experience"" by Charles Onyett from IGN, and received comparisons to games such as Team Fortress 2 and Portal. The game was praised for its cohesive story, atmosphere and its ability to catch the player's interest over a very short time span without feeling rushed or incomplete.

As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.
Players assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as ""Root Towns"" that are free of combat. They also can ""log-off"" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called ""Crimson VS"" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.
Players can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform.

It is one of the first computer games to feature realistic weaponry and tactical combat situations. 

Pursue and defeat a homicidal ex-Russian Colonel before she turns Europe into a nuclear wasteland in Project IGI: I'm Going In. This first-person shooter emphasizes stealth and guile instead of massive firepower. Jones has to sneak into the toughest military installations in Eastern Europe, and once inside, use his skills in thievery, computer hacking, sabotage, and reconnaissance to stop the madwoman. The enemy's Artificial Intelligence will react to his every action and use military tactics to track his position. In order to counter its surveillance, bunkers, tanks, and gunships, Jones is equipped with NATO spy gear and assault weapons. If the odds get stacked too high against him, he can call in a napalm strike via his Map Computer. 

Upon release the game garnered mixed reviews due to a number of shortcomings, such as poorly programmed Artificial intelligence, lack of a mid-game save option, and the lack of multiplayer features. However it was praised for its superb sound design and graphics, thanks in part to its use of a proprietary game engine that was previously used in Innerloop's Joint Strike Fighter.

In some modes holding or defending a flag is the primary goal, where in others it is simply to obtain the most frags. For all game modes, the basic objective is to kill enemy players. Before spawning, the player is presented with a large arsenal of weapons to choose from. A few grenades and a molotov cocktail are also supplied by default and more grenades can be picked up from the ground. Some servers enable secondary functions like knives, shields or nuclear kamikaze attacks. Upon death players leave behind a health pack for healing injury, the weapon and any equipped grenades for others to pick up. After waiting for a server-specified amount of time (usually less than five seconds), players respawn and may choose another weapon—this cycle repeats for the duration of the map. After a certain allotted time (usually 15 minutes), the map changes and scores are reset as players continue in another round.

Jump, perform wall jumps, toggle switches, request fireflies' assistance to open doors. Control water to find new ways through the levels. Discover many new and interesting gameplay features as you make your way throughout the four worlds of the game. 

NOT A CLASSIC PLATFORMER 

In Koloro you can't choose the way of your character. The only way to turn back is to wall jump. So, you will have to face the dangers and to solve puzzles to reach the portal with only the jumping button! 

PLAY WITH A FRIEND 

You will also be able to face danger and solve the riddles with a friend as an alternative two-player shared-screen story mode is available. Players will be able to enjoy this alternative mode together especially since the level design and the story will not be the same as the single-player mode.
