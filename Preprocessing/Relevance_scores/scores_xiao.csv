Instead, the game has been referred to as a ""shared-world shooter,"" as it lacks many of the characteristics of a traditional MMO game. For instance, rather than players being able to see and interact with all other players in the game or on a particular server—as is the case in many conventional MMO games—Destiny will include on-the-fly matchmaking that will allow players to see and interact only with other players with whom they are ""matched"" by the game.
Destiny will incorporate a new game engine that allows global illuminations and real-time dynamic lighting to occur together.

It has (almost) everything we’ve ever wanted to experience in a game like this – a non-linear campaign, deep tactical gameplay, resource management, destructible environment and a sh*tload of different weapons. The only thing we are sparing for the future (when we have moar moneys) will be role-playing and a dynamic open ended campaign.
Turn-based strategy is a thinking man’s game. You analyze your enemy for weak spots, think your moves ahead and execute them. No matter what is happening, you’ll have the time to think about your next move. Maybe it’s because we are too old to master Counter Strike, or because we suck at quick time events, but nevertheless, we think that this is the way it should be.
End State has been under development as a hobbyist project already for a decade and has seen multiple revisions, each being more advanced and more fun than the previous one. While we are targeting a more hardcore audience, the game should still be accessible enough for anyone to learn. We sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy playing it as much as we do.
GAMEPLAY
Take command of a ragtag mercenary team with multiple characters with custom skill sets and weapons, facing a variety of enemies with different capabilities and weaknesses. Plan your moves in variable terrain that forces you to consider about character positioning. Directional facing matters and characters can peek around the corners. This is important because the “fog of war” only shows what the units actually see.
Use cover for your benefit and aim your shots at specific body parts for different results. Face varying missions with different objectives ranging from planting a tracking device to releasing hostages and the enemy AI will, of course, act according to their separate motives.
Manage your team through a non-linear campaign. Recruit mercs, equip them and upgrade their skills as they gain more experience. The campaign is not linear, and in one playthrough you’ll never see everything the game has to offer. We aim to develop a future classic you can enjoy for years to come.",['Windows PC'],"['Indie', 'RPG', 'Strategy', 'Turn Based Strategy']",,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,10

Turn-based strategy games released in the last year,Conquest of Elysium 3,32106,0.6990452408790588,"Sep 03, 2012",['Illwinter Game Design'],"Conquest of Elysium 3 (CoE3) is a streamlined turn based fantasy strategy game with a touch of rogue-like and the complex undertones of Illwinter's Dominions series. While CoE3 appears to be a simple game with limited options at first glance, delving further into the game reveals a game of complex decision making and risky endeavors.
The main focus in CoE3 is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals. Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 18 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. That isn't where it ends, however, there are 6 scenarios in which your game takes place that will help randomize the map. These scenarios range from a the early days of an agrarian world to a giant gleaming capital, which you can conquer, that spawns patrols of human guards, to a fallen empire filled with the living dead and scarred by battlefields and tombs. There's also random events to contend with, from merchants to pillage to the very gates of the underworld opening portals to your realm, your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.
In each game the objective is to defeat your enemies by relying on the strengths of your chosen race. Combat in CoE3 is automatic to keep things streamlined, but that doesn't make it non-strategic. Each unit has a desired ""location"" it wants to be in the battlefield. Archers want to be in the rear, heavy infantry want to be in front. As you can imagine, putting together an army that has enough strength to protect the powerful archers and spell casters in the rear is vital. It goes beyond that though, as you must determine your enemy's strengths and hopefully be able to counter their strategy. An army of a mere 10 trolls is extremely dangerous, perhaps able to bring down a dragon, but they can only kill 10 creatures at once. An army of 50 small units will make short work of your trolls. However, an army with a wizard able to cast high level spell may completely destroy all 50 small units in one shot but would be unable to harm 10 trolls. Determining the strength and composition of an enemy army is a vital skill, and since hitting in combat, damage, and even the very spells that will be cast are randomized based on the abilities of each unit, every battle invites potential disaster and a change of plans.Key Features:
18 different classes that are unique, both in resources they need and the rituals or special abilities they have
Copious amounts of monsters and random events, good and bad
Random maps.
Spell system with 42 magic paths
Network or hotseat multiplayer
Team play, you can be 2 players against the AI for example.
Stealth and invisibility. Scouts needed to detect stealthy troops, something better (a star spawn or a beast bat will work) needed to detect the invisible ones.
Assassins that make an assassination attack before combat starts.
Catapults, Hill Giants and Rocs that can throw or drop boulders during sieges.
Immortal Liches and Vampires.
Regenerating trolls rise from the dead if they haven't been killed too badly or their side lost.
Large worms that can swallow smaller enemies whole. Swallowed units take a few points of damage from digestion each round until they are freed.
Shape changers that looks like something else when seen by the enemies.
