       "Summary         Xenoblade Chronicles X is an action role-playing video game and a part of the Xeno series of video games, serving as a spiritual successor to Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii. In a similar fashion to the original, the game plays as an open world role-playing video game, with an emphasis on exploration. Traveling can take place on foot, or in large humanoid robots, approximately four times the height of the average playable character, called \"Skells\" (\"Dolls\" in the Japanese version), that the player may opt to control. The Skells have the ability to fly, traverse water, and transform into vehicles such as motorcycles or tanks. Aerial battles will also take place in the game.\n",

       "Summary         Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2: Sisters Generation is the remake of Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2 for the PlayStation Vita developed by Felistella, which features a new selection of playable characters. Akin to the earlier remake game for the PS Vita, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1, this game also utilises the battle system from Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory in addition to a \"remake system\" which unlocks special modifications to the game. The remake features an improved framerate compared to the performance of the original mk2 PS3 game, in addition to reworked voice acting, music and visuals.\n",

       "Summary         Shin Samurai Jazz is a platform-adventure game. It combines the likes of film noir and samurai cinema, presenting them with 8-bit graphics, an electro-jazz soundtrack, and a comic/manga-like style creating a unique atmosphere.\\r\\nUnlike it's predecessor, samurai_jazz, Shin Samurai Jazz features jumping mechanics inspired by chuunori, an old technique used in kabuki theatre to give the illusion of flying. It's combat mechanics consist of hacking and slashing with the ability to juggle enemies and perform mid-air combinations, also inspired by chuunori. While the adventure elements remain intact, the puzzles are more complex with varied level designs and enemy placements/attack patterns that make use of the game's mechanics.\n",

       "Summary         BloodRayne: Betrayal is a 2011 side-scrolling action-adventure game. It is the third title in the BloodRayne series. Unlike the previous 3D hack 'n slash games before it, this game is a 2D side scroller with HD graphic sprites and very bloody attacks. It's unknown whether or not the game takes place in the same continuity as the rest of the series as its story seems self-contained. The game has a high level of difficulty, comparable to that of games such as Ninja Gaiden and some of the achievements require hours of work to achieve.\n",

       "Summary         They Bleed Pixels is a fiendishly difficult action platformer inspired by H.P. Lovecraft and classic horror. Rendered in a distinct visual style that blends pixel art with paper and ink textures, They Bleed Pixels is a singular mix of intense platforming and fierce beat-em-up action. At the core of its fighting system is a simple one-button combat scheme with surprising depth and versatility. Button mashing is discouraged while kicking shadowy monsters into saws, pits and spikes is rewarded, thanks to a unique system that lets you earn and place your own checkpoints through stylish kills. The fancier your kills, the faster you fill the checkpoint meter.\n",

       "Summary         F.E.A.R. is a horror FPS that resembles a cross between Doom 3, Half-Life, and the Ring horror movies. Demons are replaced by cloned soldiers and the element of horror revolves around an image of a spectral girl always appearing when least expected for a few fleeting moments. The player sets out as a member of a specialized strike force dealing with unknown threats. Initially, the player starts with mundane weapons, which are well presented, and progress gradually towards more sci-fi ones as the danger increases. The player can also call upon a bullet-time ability which slows down time around the player and is realised with impressive visual and aural effects by the game engine.\n",

       "Summary         Highway Acceleroid Booster is a GZDoom gameplay mod where you play as a robot girl that's part car and part super fighting robot. Armed primarily with mobility, a series of battle chips for extra combat data, and a variety of utensils installed into her gauntlets, she zips from place to place to gather additional combat data. And to help out wherever she's needed, admittedly. Helping feels nice.\\r\\nInspired by Mega Man X, gameplay feel is a little bit more cartoony and high-tech than usual, with some pretty outlandish weapons doing some silly functions.. Designed to act as a complement for sci-fi/space-age mapsets, the gameplay mod acts as a direct contrast with High Noon Drifter. Rather than being very simple and low-tech, this mod is a little bit more complicated and hi-tech.\\r\\nIf you've been looking for a mod where you can play as a robot, android, gynoid, or you've been looking for something to compliment Stardate 20X7, this might be up your alley.\n",

       "Summary         Front Mission 5: Scars of the War is the fifth in Square's Front Mission tactical RPG series. It brings the player back to a gritty futuristic world in which conflicts are waged between five world powers: the U.S.N., O.C.U., E.C., O.A.C., and the Republic of Zaftra. Such conflicts are waged with the wanzer, Front Mission-speak for mecha.\\r\\nGameplay-wise, the game is a true return to Front Mission 2 roots while incorporating various features from Front Mission 1, 3, and 4. The player takes part in turn-based missions, which pit their group of wanzers against enemy forces. Old features that have returned include the ability to upgrade parts and mission branching. New features to Front Mission 5 include friendly fire and the ability to recruit new pilots.\n",
